## Hiï¼Œ I'm Paradoxiao ðŸ‘‹

You ask what is "Paradoxiao"? It is a word including "paradox" and "xiao". The reason I use "paradox" is I extremely love [The Paradox Engine](https://moapyr.fandom.com/wiki/Paradox_Engine) in the Mental Omega ! And the "Xiao" is from a warship named [CN ChiXiao](https://mwstats.info/ships/cn-chixiao-7w1kzoq2) .

I'm now a college school student .

I like to do something interesting about computer . My favorite operator system is Arch Linux . I like to play a lot of games such like [Mental Omega](https://mentalomega.com/) and [Minecraft](minecraft.net) .
